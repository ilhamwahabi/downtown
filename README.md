# Downtown

## What is this?

App to display remaining time. Just like another timer.

Initial purpose why I built this is for show to examinee how much time left in course exam. I'm doing that as laboratory assistant.

Built with:

- React + Typescript, i think this is my common stack now
- Hooks for state management, i'm doing experiment with useContext + useReducer and it works well!
- Aphrodite for styling, because in my previous internship (Dekoruma) I'm using react native and this library gave me same vibe

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies `yarn`
3. Run aplication `yarn start`
4. Deploy it `yarn deploy`

Or try directly here: https://iwgx.github.io/downtown/

## Todo:

1. Add critical mode, for example counter color became color when near the end
2. Another counter form, maybe bar & pie?
3. Settings button for above
4. Fix few bugs

   - last input not focus to start button when it was input that first changed
